The western monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) is protected under the federal Endangered Species Act (California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2024). Their populations have been heavily declining over the past 50 years, largely due to the loss of their over-wintering and breeding habitat (Pelton et al. 2019). Milkweed (Asclepias spp.) provides essential habitat throughout the butterflies’ life cycle and, for this reason, milkweed habitats will also be protected under the monarchs’ “federally endangered” classification. Unfortunately, milkweed populations are also facing pressing threats such as habitat loss, drought, and commercial pesticide use (Bahmani et al. 2018, Boyle et. al. 2019, Los Padres Forest Watch 2013, Pleasants and Oberhauser 2013). 
Motivated by concerns over the loss of monarch habitat, the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden (SBBG) and local collaborators are working to restore milkweed habitat and identify potential restoration areas in the Los Padres National Forest (LPNF). The SBBG has completed one year of their two-year survey, in which the staff aims to revisit up to 1,000 historic populations of four species of early-season milkweed (A. californica, A. vestita, A. eriocarpa, and A. erosa). This is a large-scale, resource-intensive task, as the LPNF covers a total of 1.75 million acres and stretches almost 220 miles from north to south (USDA Forest Service n.d.).
