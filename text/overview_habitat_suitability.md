# <i class="fa-solid fa-leaf"></i> Milkweed Habitat Suitability

On this page, you can examine habitat suitability modeled across the Los Padres National Forest (LPNF) for four early-season milkweed species. These predictions were created utilizing a [Maximum Entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_maximum_entropy) modeling approach in R which modeled milkweed habitat suitability based on precipitation, temperature, vegetation density, and heat load index. All code is publicly available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/milkweed-mod/milkweed-mod). 

The grid of four maps below shows the areas in the LPNF that our model predicts to be suitable for each of the four species of early-season milkweed.
