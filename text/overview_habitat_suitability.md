# <i class="fa-solid fa-leaf"></i> Milkweed Habitat Suitability Models

On this page, you can examine habitat suitability modeled across the Los Padres National Forest (LPNF) for four early-season milkweed species. These predictions were created utilizing a [Maximum Entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_maximum_entropy) modeling approach in R using [Wallace](https://wallaceecomod.github.io/wallace/articles/tutorial-v2.html#model) as a foundation. You can find this code [here](https://github.com/milkweed-mod/milkweed-mod). 

The SBBG collected information on four species of early-season milkweed (*A. californica*, *A. vestita*, *A. eriocarpa*, and *A. erosa*) in 2023 in the southern region of the LPNF. 

The grid of four maps below shows the areas in the LPNF that our model predicts to be suitable for each of the four species of early-season milkweed.
