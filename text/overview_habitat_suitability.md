# <i class="fa-solid fa-leaf"></i> Milkweed Habitat Suitability Models

In this section you can examine habitat suitability modeled across the Los Padres National Forest for four early-season milkweed species. These predictions were created utilizing a Maximum Entropy modeling approach. The SBBG collects information on four species of milkweed (*A. californica, A. vestita, A. eriocarpa, and A. erosa*). These data were collected in 2023 in the Los Padres National Forest.
