The Santa Barbara Botanic Garden (SBBG) has collected information on four species of early-season milkweed (*A. californica*, *A. vestita*, *A. eriocarpa*, and *A. erosa*) through surveys in the Los Padres National Forest (LPNF). The map below shows the field survey points, collected in 2023, that the SBBG has collected. You can visualize where samples were collected for the species of your choice, or any combination of species using the checkboxes below. Each species is represented on the map by a circle, which is colored by species.

In order to visualize a species, you will select the species of choice, by clicking on the species button. You are able to select multiple buttons at a time. Note: if none of the buttons are selected (indicated by the button turning yellow) there will be no points displayed within the boundary of the LPNF.
