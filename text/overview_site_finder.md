# <i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass-location"></i>     High-Priority Survey Sites 

On this page, you can visualize the survey site priority index score of each location in the Los Padres National Forest (LPNF) for each of the four species of early-season milkweed. This priority index is based on the milkweed habitat suitability for each species and the total survey site accessibility. The resultant value of that product has been rescaled from 0 to 1 to indicate the relative priority of each location for each species. 

In order to visualize the priority index for a species across the LPNF, you will select the species of choice, by clicking on the species button. You are only able to select one button at a time. Note: a button will always be selected on this page.
