# <i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass-location"></i>     Survey Site Finder 


The map below shows the survey site priority index score of each location in the LPNF for each of the four species of early-season milkweed. This priority index is the product of the milkweed habitat suitability for each species and the total survey site accessibility raster. The resultant value of that product has been rescaled from 0 to 1 to indicate the relative priority of each location for each species. 

The table below the map shows the priority scores for each species at each location (latitude and longitude) as well as the visit status (if the location has been visited previously by the SBBG team). The search bar allows you to filter the results to a specific visit status, priority level, or location. The download buttons allow you to download those filtered (or unfiltered) results in your desired format.
