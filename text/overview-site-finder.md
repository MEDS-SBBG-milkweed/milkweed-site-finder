In this section you are able to receive a list of coordinates in order to help inform planning for site surveys. You can visualize the species of your choice, or any combination of species utilizing the drop-down menu of species. The resulting map will be the combination of the habitat suitability model as well as the site accessibility index. You can then zoom to the region that you would like to receive a list of coordinates for the species chosen that are the most accessible.
