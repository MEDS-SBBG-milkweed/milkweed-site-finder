The western monarch butterfly (*Danaus plexippus*) is protected under the federal Endangered Species Act (California Department of Fish and Wildlife, 2024). Their populations have been heavily declining over the past 50 years, largely due to the loss of their overwintering and breeding habitat (Pelton et al., 2019). Milkweed (Asclepias sp.) provides essential habitat throughout the butterflies’ life cycle, and for this reason, milkweed habitat will also be protected under the monarchs’ “federally endangered” classification. Unfortunately, milkweed populations are also facing pressing threats such as habitat loss, drought, and commercial pesticide use (Bahmani et al., 2018; Boyle et. al., 2019; Los Padres Forest Watch, 2013; Pleasants & Oberhauser, 2013). 

Motivated by concerns over the loss of monarch habitat, the SBBG and local collaborators are working to restore milkweed habitat and identify potential restoration areas in the LPNF. The SBBG has completed the first of a two-year survey, in which the research team aims to revisit up to 1,000 historic locations of populations of four species of early-season milkweed (*A. californica, A. vestita, A. eriocarpa*, and *A. erosa*). This is a large-scale, resource-intensive task, as the LPNF covers a total of 1.75 million acres and stretches almost 220 miles from north to south (USDA Forest Service National Website, n.d.). **Thus, this interactive web dashboard has been created as part of a MEDS Capstone project for the UCSB Bren School of Environmental Sciences to aid in the planning of future survey efforts, as well as to visualize survey data.**
