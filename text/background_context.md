Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) populations are experiencing decline due to habitat degradation and climate threats. In 2024, this iconic species became protected under the Endangered Species Act. Critical to the persistence of this species of cultural and ecological importance is milkweed (Asclepias spp.), which monarchs rely on as an essential resource for food and reproduction. Motivated by concerns over the loss of monarch habitat, the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden (SBBG) and local collaborators are working to identify potential restoration areas in the Los Padres National Forest (LPNF). This is a large-scale, resource-intensive task, as the LPNF covers a total of 1.75 million acres and stretches almost 220 miles from north to south. We identified high priority sites for the team to survey based on high predicted suitability for each species of early-season milkweed and high physical accessibility. **Thus, this interactive web dashboard has been created as part of a MEDS Capstone project for the UCSB Bren School of Environmental Sciences to aid in the planning of future survey efforts, as well as to visualize survey data.**
