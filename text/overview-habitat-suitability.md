In this section you can choose which species of milkweed you would like to be modeled across the Los Padres National Forest. The model will predict habitat suitability for the species of milkweed. These predictions were created utilizing a Maximum Entropy modeling approach. The SBBG collects information on four species of milkweed (*A. californica, A. vestita, A. eriocarpa, and A. erosa*). These data were collected in 2023 in the Los Padres National Forest. You can visualize the species of your choice, or any combination of species utilizing the drop-down menu of species.
