The table below shows the priority scores for each species at each location (latitude and longitude) and whether the location has been visited previously by the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden (SBBG) team. You can also see the accessibility score associated with each location in the Accessibility Score column. 

The search bar allows you to filter the results by visit status, priority level, or location. 

The download buttons allow you to download those filtered (or unfiltered) results in your desired format.
