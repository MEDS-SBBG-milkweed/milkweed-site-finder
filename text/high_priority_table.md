The table below shows the priority scores for each species at each location (latitude and longitude) and whether the location has been visited previously by the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden (SBBG) team. You can also see the accessibility score associated with each location in the Accessibility Score column. 

The search bar allows you to filter the results by visit status, priority level, or location. In order to filter you will click on the arrows next to the name of the column. This will sort the data table by either ascending or descending order. 

By selecting the The CSV button you will download those filtered (or unfiltered) results into a .csv file in your web browser.
