# <i class="fa-solid fa-universal-access"></i>     Survey Site Accessibility 


Here you can visualize the survey site accessibility of each location in the LPNF. We created this index to create a relative measure of how physically accessible each location – represented by a raster cell – is for the SBBG team. 

For example, a score of 1 will indicate that the location within the forest is very accessible to the SBBG team, and a score of 0 will indicate that a location is inaccessible within the forest. The layers that contribute to this index are as follows:
Distance from trails: 0 is farthest from a trail, 1 is closest to a trail
Distance from roads: 0 is farthest from a road, 1 is closest to a road
Vegetation density: 0 is the most dense vegetation, 1 is the most sparse vegetation 
Land Ownership: 0 if private land, 1 if public land
Slope: 0 is the most steep terrain, 1 is the most flat terrain

You can select which one of these layers you want to visualize in the map on the **left**, and the map on the **right** shows the total survey site accessibility index, which is the product of all of the layers.
