The Milkweed Site Finder Dashboard is an interactive web dashboard that assists the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden's (SBBG) restoration efforts of early-season milkweed by identifying the highest priority locations to survey.

From the left navigation panel, you’ll find details on where the milkweed species of interest have been identified, which habitats are most suitable for each species, how accessible sites are, and which sites should be prioritized within the [Los Padres National Forest](https://www.fs.usda.gov/lpnf) (LPNF). 

This dashboard was made with [Shiny in R](https://shiny.posit.co/) – all source code is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/milkweed-mod/milkweed-site-finder).
