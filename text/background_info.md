Milkweed Site Finder is an app that assists the SBBG's restoration efforts by identifying the highest priority locations to survey

From the left navigation panel, you’ll find details on where milkweed has been identified, which habitats are most suitable for milkweed, how accessible sites are, and which sites should be prioritized within the [Los Padres National Forest](https://www.fs.usda.gov/lpnf). 

This dashboard was made with [Shiny in R](https://shiny.posit.co/) – all source code is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/milkweed-mod/milkweed-site-finder).
